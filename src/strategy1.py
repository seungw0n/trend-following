    Description:
        The program is not complete, it is still at the experimental stage.
        This script contains two things: selecting stock codes, and back-testing the strategy.
        The program considers an increasing rate at the closing times.
        Please do not trust an output of the program.

    Expected return: on avg 2%
    Actual return: on avg x%
